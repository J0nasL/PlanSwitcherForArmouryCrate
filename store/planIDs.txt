# This is a comment

# This document contains a list of plan names and corresponding IDs
# It is used to preserve the IDs of imported plans, which don't always show up
# in the Windows power plan menu and powercfg /L

# This serves as a backup in case a plan doesn't show up, in which case it will appear listed as "hidden"
# If all of your imported plans do show up correctly
# Entries are automatically added to this file when importing

# You only need to edit this file when manually importing or deleting a power plan
# In that case, you should add or remove an entry to/from this file as below

# Entries should be formatted like:
# PlanName|plan-GUID
# ex:
# Turbo|81694dcd-aead-4b1b-a189-d51bee7adc46
